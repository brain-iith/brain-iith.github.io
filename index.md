Welcome to the blog of Bayesian Reasoning And INference (BRAIN) research group of CSE Department at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. Our research group deals with probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian data analysis to solve real world problems. We develop probabilistic models to solve problems arising in the areas of numerical methods,  deep learning, natural language processing, social media, and vision.
