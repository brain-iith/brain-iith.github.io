## Neural Ordinal Differential Equation - Sample Post

We will discuss NODE in this blog. 
Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural 
network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models 
have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for 
speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. 

You can add equations as follows - 
$$
\sum_n (x)
$$

NODE is a continuous depth Resnet model
